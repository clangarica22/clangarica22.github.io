### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    I think this lab was one of the most interesting because it required many revisions, mainly in Part 1. The code had to be perfectly written in order for the pattern to come out correctly. Because so much precision was necessary, I had to think critically about each line rather than guess until I got the right results. The double loop was the most complicated part of an assignment I had seen up to that point in our class. Part 2 was repetitive but I found “while” loops to be very interesting to learn about and use properly.
* Lab 9

    This lab was an important exercise in learning how to keep code organized. Having functions separate from the main function is an interesting concept that I felt I could make a lot of use out of. It made me aware of the endless possibilities of code and programs. Both Part 1 and 2 also helped me practice keeping track of multiple different variables, and tracing them throughout the code to see what happens to them.
* Lab 10

    I found this lab very valuable because it taught me how to use many different tools, more than most other labs. We made use of loops and file streams, and learned how to use “getline” properly. Part 1 was our introduction to header files, which is something I previously would not have thought is possible. I was curious as to how separate files get combined to make one program. Part 2 introduced us to 2D vectors, which I also find fascinating and want to make more use of in the future. We received a lot of help on Part 3, so writing the code did not take too much effort, but I still thought the code was unique. I took time to read about how it works, and it made me want to find out more about how graphics are processed.
